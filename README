     Some pictures, docs, keepsakes and ATMega boot burning procedures


threadsLib
----------
     stdTypes, Threads, stdInterrupts : threading library. 
                                        For usage see stdThreads.h and examples below
                                        
     other sources in this dir        : copied from NerkKits and made reentrant


Demo programs:
-------------

    sanityTest
    ----------
         Simple serial LED blinker to test sanity of a newly wired NerdKits board


    tasksDemo
    ---------
         Multi-threading  demonstration, with different threads writing in (quasi) parallel 
         to areas that they own on the NerdKits lcd screen. Also showing binary number counting
         (of course by a separate thread) on PC0..3.


    timeCtxSwitch
    -------------
         Test program for measuring thread context switches


    uartSanityTest
    --------------
         Some more involved sanity test, also including the uart



Projects:
--------
    LEDDisplayDriverDemo
    --------------------
         Sample driver for a 2-digit LED display. See pictures in archive/.
         In order to economize on AVR IO pins, the corresponding segment pins
         are connected, and the digits are rapidly and alternately shown.
         Also some fun code is added to alternately dim and brighten digit
         brightness. The application shows the current temperature by
         reading the LM34 temperature sensor.


    IRbeam
    ------
         Ultra low power IR pulse transmitter and receiver. This is an application for
         Mike Hobbs's salamander traps, which take pictures based on observed interruptions
         of the beam.


    IRreceiver
    ----------
         Test bench for IR remote receiving.


    IRfrustrator
    ------------
         Sample app for IR remote receiving and sending: monitor IR remote commands and 
         transmit random samples at random times. Great for leaving in the room when
         people are watching television.


    ledArray
    --------
         Sample driver for a home built 5x5 led display grid.


    shiftRegister
    -------------
         Sample driver for inputting a sequence of bits into a 74595 shift register,
         optionally using explicit GPIO pin toggling, or using the SPI




Note that Makefile doesn't make anything, it only clears all of the subdirectories.
The Makefile in the different application directories actually do build everything needed, and
starts avrdude upon successful build. Make sure you have sudo privileges (Linux). The mechanics 
of all of that is in Makefile.inc. That file also allows configuring the MMCU (atmega168 or atmega328p),
and the frequencies of chip clock and kernel timer.

Also, note that stdSetup() shuts down all unused devices. If any of them need to be used
by the application then they need to be reenabled. See thread kernel implementation stdThreads.h/.c
